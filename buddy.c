/**
 * Prints the details of a given node for debugging purposes.
 * 
 * ## Usage:
 * - Call this function when you need to inspect the properties of a node 
 *   during allocation, deallocation, or tree traversal.
 * - Pass a descriptive `message` to help identify where in the process 
 *   the function is being called.
 * - If the `node` is `NULL`, the function will print an appropriate message 
 *   and return immediately.
 * 
 * ## Example:
 * ```c
 * print_node_details(node, "Checking node before allocation");
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Output:
 * ```
 * Checking node before allocation: Node size=64K, offset=128K, is_split=1, is_free=0
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Notes:
 * - The size and offset are displayed in kilobytes for readability.
 * - `is_split` indicates whether the node has been divided into two smaller blocks.
 * - `is_free` shows whether the node is available for allocation.
 * - This function does not modify any node properties—use it purely for debugging.

/**
 * Creates a new node in the buddy system.
 * 
 * This function initializes a new node representing a block of memory in the 
 * buddy allocator system. Each node corresponds to a contiguous region of memory 
 * within the overall memory pool. Nodes are structured hierarchically, forming 
 * a binary tree where each non-leaf node is a split block, and each leaf node 
 * represents an allocated or free memory block.
 * 
 * ## Parameters:
 * - `size`: The size of the memory block this node represents. This value must 
 *   always be a power of two and corresponds to the total space managed by this node.
 * - `mempool_offset`: The starting offset of this block within the memory pool. 
 *   This value is used to locate the memory associated with this node.
 * - `parent`: A pointer to the parent node in the buddy tree. If this is the 
 *   root node, the parent is NULL.
 * 
 * ## Behavior:
 * - The function allocates memory for a new `Node` structure.
 * - It marks the node as free (`is_free = true`) because newly created nodes are 
 *   initially unallocated.
 * - It marks the node as not split (`is_split = false`) since splitting occurs 
 *   only when a request requires a smaller block.
 * - It sets `left` and `right` child pointers to `NULL` since this node has not 
 *   been split yet.
 * - It sets the `parent` pointer to the provided parent node.
 * - It assigns the given `size` and `mempool_offset` values to track the memory 
 *   block’s characteristics.
 * - The function returns a pointer to the newly created node.
 * 
 * ## Notes for Students:
 * - This function does not handle memory allocation failures (e.g., `malloc` 
 *   returning NULL). Consider what happens if `malloc` fails in a real-world system.
 * - `mempool_offset` is critical for tracking memory locations. When splitting a 
 *   node, the left child should inherit the same `mempool_offset`, while the right 
 *   child should be offset by `size / 2`. Ensure you understand how offsets change 
 *   when nodes are split.
 * - The returned node is always a single, unallocated block of memory until it is 
 *   either allocated or split into smaller blocks.
 * 
 * @param size The size of the memory block this node represents.
 * @param mempool_offset The offset in the memory pool where this block starts.
 * @param parent A pointer to the parent node, or NULL if this is the root.
 * @return A pointer to the newly created node.

/**
 * Creates a new buddy allocator instance.
 * 
 * This function initializes the buddy memory allocator by creating a root node 
 * that represents the entire available memory pool. The buddy allocator is 
 * structured as a binary tree, where each node represents a contiguous block 
 * of memory that can be split into smaller blocks as allocations occur.
 * 
 * ## Parameters:
 * - This function does not take any parameters since it initializes the entire 
 *   memory pool from a predefined `TOTAL_MEMORY` size.
 * 
 * ## Behavior:
 * - Allocates memory for a `BuddyAllocator` structure, which acts as the 
 *   top-level manager for the allocation system.
 * - Calls `create_node` to generate the root node of the buddy tree:
 *   - The root node represents the full memory pool.
 *   - The `mempool_offset` is set to `0` since the root starts at the beginning 
 *     of the memory pool.
 *   - The parent of the root node is `NULL` because it has no parent.
 * - Returns a pointer to the newly created allocator.
 * 
 * ## Notes for Students:
 * - The buddy system starts with one large free block. As allocations occur, 
 *   the system will split blocks to create appropriately sized chunks.
 * - `TOTAL_MEMORY` must be a power of two for the buddy system to function 
 *   correctly, as each split produces two equal-sized child blocks.
 * - The allocator only manages metadata about the memory. The actual memory 
 *   pool would typically be stored separately (e.g., as an array or direct 
 *   system memory allocation).
 * - Consider what happens if `malloc` fails when creating the allocator or the 
 *   root node. In a production system, how should failures be handled?
 * 
 * @return A pointer to the newly created `BuddyAllocator` structure.

/**
 * Splits a given node into two smaller buddy blocks.
 *
 * ## Purpose:
 * - This function is responsible for dividing a memory block into two equal-sized sub-blocks.
 * - Used when an allocation request requires a smaller block than the current node size.
 *
 * ## Expected Behavior:
 * - The function should only proceed if:
 *   - The node is **not already split**.
 *   - The node size is **greater than** the minimum block size (`MIN_BLOCK_SIZE`).
 * - Creates two child nodes:
 *   - **Left child**: Takes the same memory pool offset as the parent.
 *   - **Right child**: Takes the offset of the left child **plus half the parent size**.
 * - Marks the current node as **split** (`is_split = true`).
 *
 * ## Example:
 * ```
 * Initial Tree:
 *   F (64K)
 * 
 * After `split(node)` on 64K block:
 *   FS (64K)
 *     F (32K)
 *     F (32K)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Notes:
 * - **This function does not allocate memory**; it simply creates structure nodes.
 * - **The actual memory division happens logically** through the buddy system.
 * - The caller must check that `split` is necessary before calling it.
 * - The **offset of the right child** ensures proper tracking of memory segments.
 *
 * ## Potential Issues:
 * - If the node is already split, calling `split` again should do nothing.
 * - A node **must** have a size greater than `MIN_BLOCK_SIZE` to split.
 * - If `create_node` fails (returns NULL), the function should handle it gracefully (students should consider this).

/**
 * Recursively allocates memory from the buddy system.
 *
 * ## Purpose:
 * - Searches for a free block of the requested `size` within the buddy system.
 * - If a sufficiently sized block is found, it is allocated.
 * - If the block is too large, it is split into two smaller blocks, and allocation continues recursively.
 *
  * ## Expected Behavior:
 * - The function should stop searching if the node cannot be used for allocation, either because it is 
 *   too small, already allocated, or missing.
 * - If the node is a perfect fit for the request, it should be assigned only if it hasn’t been previously divided.
 * - When the node is larger than necessary, it should be split into two equal parts if it hasn’t been divided already.
 * - The function should attempt to allocate from the left subtree first and only check the right subtree if 
 *   the left cannot fulfill the request.
 *
 * ## Example:
 * ```
 * Initial Tree:
 *   F (64K)
 *
 * Allocating 16K:
 *   FS (64K)
 *     FS (32K)
 *       FS (16K)
 *         A (8K)
 *         F (8K)
 *       F (32K)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Notes:
 * - **Splitting only happens when needed**, keeping fragmentation minimal.
 * - **Left-first allocation** ensures small blocks cluster toward the left side of the tree.
 * - The function naturally **backtracks** if a smaller block isn't available in the left subtree.
 * - **Returning NULL means allocation failed** due to lack of sufficient free space.
 *
 * ## Potential Issues:
 * - If the recursion is not correctly implemented, **memory fragmentation may occur**.
 * - If a node is already split but its children are fully allocated, **allocation should fail**.
 * - Ensure that allocated nodes are correctly marked **not free** (`is_free = false`).
 * - Edge cases:
 *   - **Allocating more than available memory** should fail.
 *   - **Allocating less than `MIN_BLOCK_SIZE`** may require rounding up.
 *   - **Handling multiple allocations in sequence** should still leave space for future allocations.

 * ## How It Works:
 * - If the requested `size` is smaller than the minimum block size, it is adjusted to `MIN_BLOCK_SIZE`.
 * - If the requested `size` is larger than the total available memory, the function returns `NULL`.
 * - The allocation process is delegated to `allocate_recursive`, which:

 *   - Allocates the first suitable free block found.
 * - If no block is found, the function returns `NULL`.
 * - If allocation succeeds, the function computes the memory address based on the 
 *   offset within the allocator’s memory pool and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
 *
 * ## Expected Behavior:
 * - Requests smaller than `MIN_BLOCK_SIZE` are rounded up.
